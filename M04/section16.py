The Weirdstone of Brisingamen, Alan Garner, 1960
Perdido Street Station, China Mi√©ville, 2000

Small Gods, Terry Preatchett, 1922
"""

#and a table called books with these fields: title (text), author (text), and year (integer).

# As in 8.8, select and print the title column from the book table in alphabetical order.
